            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The <strong>Insurance Prediction Project</strong> is a machine learning–based web application designed to estimate an individual’s medical insurance charges. 
                It analyzes important personal and lifestyle factors such as <strong>age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of dependents, smoking habits, and residential region</strong> to generate accurate and reliable predictions.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The main goal of this project is to make the process of understanding insurance pricing more transparent and data-driven. 
                Instead of relying on guesswork or generic estimates, users can instantly receive a personalized cost prediction that reflects their health profile and lifestyle choices.
                This empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their medical coverage and financial planning.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                From a broader perspective, the project demonstrates how <strong>data science and artificial intelligence</strong> can be applied to the insurance industry to improve accuracy, fairness, and efficiency. 
                It can help insurance companies assess risk more precisely, reduce manual errors, and offer customers policies that truly match their needs.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Beyond predictions, this system also serves as an educational tool — helping users understand how small lifestyle changes (like quitting smoking or maintaining a healthy BMI) can significantly lower their potential insurance costs. 
                By combining technology, health awareness, and financial insight, this project aims to create a smarter and more transparent future for health insurance.
